README - dotrc repo

Just a set of config files for common linux tools I use.
There is a little bit of automated set-up via a bash script.
This is not one of those pretentious "dotfiles" repos.

Usage:
```
git submodule update --init
./deploy
```
(run from inside the repo's root directory to symlink all .files)

Reminders:
